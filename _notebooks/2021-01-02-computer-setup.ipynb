    "This post is mostly designed to help my future self remember what I like about my developer setup for a new (osx) laptop. Every time I need to do this, at work or on a personal computer, I find that the software or my preferences have changed enough to make the previous list not as automatic as it could be and it forces me to take the time to re-research everything I need. Maybe this is a good idea to be doing once in a while, but why not have a nice set of defaults and edit from there if needed. Theoretically, this could be one script that I pull and run, but for now it'll be a list of links, scripts, and commentary."

    "> Nix is a really powerful environment management tool. It's not really fair to have this presented in comparison to conda since it does so much more, but for my purposes they end up being pretty similar. Nix creates environments \"all the way down\" installing everything from scratch which means you can guarantee envs that work today will work tomorrow. Or put another way, envs that work on your computer will work on your colleague's computer. This is a really strong claim and not even docker can guarantee that nothing under the hood will change between builds off the same dockerfile. However, it's not the most user friendly or well documented and building nix envs takes a while. If, for whatever reason, something isn't working with nix then it'll likely be a pain to figure out and drag you into the parts of your computer you hoped to ignore. Also, if you want to deploy with nix then you have to deal with rebuilding the envs everywhere, which again, takes a while. There are ways to address all of this, but you have to be ready to dig in -- it really comes down to a trade off between ease and stability. Case and point, for now, installing nix on osx is a bit of a mess but you can follow the steps in either of the first two links then run the final command:\n",
